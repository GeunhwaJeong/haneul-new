//! [`ChildObjectResolver`] adapter.
//!
//! `ChildObjectResolver` is one of the supertrait bounds on
//! [`haneul_types::storage::RpcStateReader`]. Its methods feed the
//! Move runtime's dynamic-field / receive-object paths. **This
//! adapter is read-only and does not serve Move execution**: it
//! returns `Ok(None)` from both methods.
//!
//! Callers that need execution-time child-object resolution
//! (re-running a transaction, simulating dry-runs) should keep
//! using the validator perpetual store — this adapter is meant
//! for the read-only RPC surface where child-object lookups never
//! arise.
